6. SSH into server
    - ssh -i[key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]
7. Caddy
    - webserve that listens for incoming HTTP requests
    - routes requests--> gateway or reverse proxy
8. HTTPS/TLS
    - HTTPS (Secure HyperText Transport Protocol)
    - TLS (negotiates shared secret and used to encrypt data)
    - uses handshakes that verify web certificate
    - Web certificates are generated by trusted 3rd party using public/private key encryption (cheaper because of Let's Encrypt-->creates them for free)
9. HTML
    - elements are enclosed in tags
    - html element--> represents top level page structure
    - head element -->metadata about page and page title
    - body element --> content structure
    - main element --> main content structure
    - attributes give specific detatils of an element
    - id, class helps group things
    - hyperlinks (<a href="__">Title</a>
    - Always inclue <!DOCTYPE html> at the top of document
    - nav (navigational inputs)
    - section (section of main content)
    - aside (aside content of main content)
    - div (block division)
    - span (inline span of content)
    - b (bring attention)
    - img (image reference)
    - dialog (interactive component such as confirmation)
    - Comments (<!-- _____ -->)
    - body has children (header, main, footer)
    - block (div, p)
    - inline (b, span)
    - form (input container and submission)
    - fieldset (labeled input grouping)
    - input (multiple types of user input: text, date, checkbox, color, etc w/ attributes (name, disabled, value, required) w/ validation (certain patterns)
    - select (selection dropdown)
    - optgroup (grouped selection dropdown)
    - option (selection option)
    - textarea (multiline text input)
    - label (individual input label)
    - output (output of input)
    - meter (display value with a known range)
    - index.html default display for web browser
    - external media (img, audio, video)
    - For images, it is best to have them saved in a repository and use the reference links so it does not take as long to load
    - Always include an alt for images (for accessibility)
    - images (<img src="_" alt="_")
    - audio (src, controls or it autoplays and loops)
    - video (src, controls or autoplay, crossorgin="anonymous" (when requssting files from different domain)
    - internal media (svg, canvas)
    - Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)
    - Canvas (2D drawing/animation)
    - Structure is like a tree
    - Be sure to close out all tags
    - Spans hightlight specific text or sections
10. Simon HTML
    - need a deploy file to be able to send to website
    - include navigation on every page
    - Use Live Server to view so you can debug
11. CSS
    - Cascading Style Sheets (style html)
    - responseive to actions of user and device rendered on
    - animate page, deploy custom fonts, respond to user actions, dynamically alter entire layout based on size of device
    - rulesets --> selector, declarations, property, value
    - Example (p (selector){color (property): (declaration) green (value); (rule)}
    - Ways to associate CSS with HTML
          1. Style attribute in specific HTML element
          2. Style element (<style>) within HTML document
          3. HTML link to create hyperlink ref to external file with CSS rules (<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />) ** preferred way
    - Lowest level overrides higher declaration
    - Box model (inner to outer--> content, padding, border, margin)
    - Selectors (* to select all)
    - descendant combinator (ex. section h2)--> has to be a descendent of previous item
    - child-->list of direct children (ex. section > p)
    - general sibling --> list of siblings (ex. div ~ p)
    - adjacent sibling --> list of adjacent sibling (ex. div + p)
    - Class selector (.classname {})
    - Can combine with element name (ex. p.classname{})
    - ID selector (unique for a specific element) (ex. #id {})
    - Attribute selector (ex. p[class='summary'] {} or a[href] {})
    - Pseudo selector--> selects basked on position, hyperlick visit, or mouse interactions (ex. section:hover {})
    - CSS Declarations (property=value)
    - Units for values (pixels (px) or inches (in) or % of parent element or % of minimum viewport dimension (vmin) or multiplier of size of letter m in root font (rem), pt(number of points 1/72 in), cm (centimenters), em (multiplier of width of letter m in parent font), ex (height of element font), vw, vh (viewport width or height), vmax (%of viewportlarger dimension)
    - Color: keyword (red), RGB (#00FFAA22 or #0FA2), rgb function (rgb(128,255,128,0.5) with opacity as last thing), HSL (hsl(180,30%,90%,0.5) hue,saturation (how gray), light (how bright))
    - font-family to import fonts, list several in order of desire b/c some systems don't have some types
    - font families--> serif, sans-serif, fixed, symbol (emojis or arrows)
    - @font-face {} to load one you provide
    - load from font provider (@import url()) using Good Font Service
    - Animation--> use animation properties, define keyframes (how it looks at different times)
    - in element reference animation (animation-name and animation-duration)
    - @keyframes nameofanimation { from {} to{} }
    - can add % of the way through stops in between from and to 
12. Responsive Design
    - change how HTML element displayed
    - none (don't display)
    - block (width of parent element)
    - inline (width as big as contents)
    - flex (flexible orientation)
    - grid (grid orientation)
    - include meta tag in head element so mobile browser scaling does not get in the way (<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" />
    - float (moves element to left or right and allows inline elements to wray around) (ex. aside {float:right; } stays of right side while text flows around)
    - Media queries (@media) dynamically detects size and orientation, can use it too see which side is longest on device so we know how to orient) or to know when to not display some items
    - Grid (display:grid; ) (fr-->gractional unit of parentss total width)
    - Flexbox (partition application into areas that move around as window resized or orientation changes) (display: flex; flex-direction:column or row; flex:1(one-fractional unit)) (row-->side by side, column-->on top of each other)
    - Frameworks (tailwind-->newer, apply to specific HTML elements--> mostly in HTML file) (bootstrap--> (include in head <link href="", rel="stylesheet", integrity="", crossorigin-"anonymous" />) (include at end of body element (incorporate javascript module) <script src="" integrity="" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>)
    - Debugging (inspect, Elements tab, Styles pane)-->can change things directly in debugger
    - flex to delimit header, main, and footer (responsive to different screen sizes)
    - absolute position relative to parent elements
14. JavaScript
    - officially ECMAScript--> weakly typed language
    - most used programming language (web servers and serverless functions)
    - executed using an interpreter instead of compiling (very portable but allows for errors (only discovered when crashes during execution))
    - console.log(___) outputs ot debugger console
    - concatenate using +
    - write functions (function name(variable){return variable+' ';}
    - line comment //
    - block comment /* */
    - end statements with ;, code blocks/scope defined w/ {}
    - console.time('demo time'); code; console.timeEnd('demo time');
    - console.count(_);
    - Adding to HTML
          - src attribute of script element (reference js file)
          - directly in HTML in script element (ex. write function here)
    - onclick-->creates event listener for DOM events that call code in attribute value
    - declare variables with let or const, never var
    - primitive types: null (not assigned value), undefined (has not been defined), Boolean, number, bigInt (arbitrary magnitude), String, Symbol (unique value)
    - object types: object (collection of properties represented by name-value pairs (ex. {a:3, b:'fish'}), function, date, array, map, JSON (lightweight data-interchange format (ex. {"a":3,"b":"fish"})
    - operators: + (add), - (subtract), * (multiply), / (divide), === (equality), for strings (+ and ===)
    - type conversions: weakly typed-->type changes when assigned new value or automatically converted in certain contexts (automatic converstion) (== less intuitive use === for strict inequality)
    - examples (2 + '3';
        // OUTPUT: '23'
        2 * '3';
        // OUTPUT: 6
        [2] + [3];
        // OUTPUT: '23'
        true + null;
        // OUTPUT: 1
        true + undefined;
        // OUTPUT: NaN)
    - examples (1 == '1';
        // OUTPUT: true
        null == undefined;
        // OUTPUT: true
        '' == false;
        // OUTPUT: true)
      -examples (1 === '1';
        // OUTPUT: false
        null === undefined;
        // OUTPUT: false
        '' === false;
        // OUTPUT: false)
    - Conditionals (if, else, else if)
    - ternary operator (ex. a===1? console.log(1) : console.log('not 1');)
    - boolean operations (&&(and) || (or) ! (not))
    - loops (for, for in, for of, while, do while, switch)
    - for in (const name in obj-->prints out first part of each object, const name in array-->prints out the array index)
    - for of (const val of arr-->print value at each index)
    - break or continue also available
    - string-->specified by ',", or ` (` are string literal that could have JavaScript evaluated in place and concatenated into string)
    - string literal replacement specifier ${} use backticks
    - use backticks to create multiline strings w/o having to use \n
    - Unicode-->must internationalize (uses sequence of 16-bit unsigned integers)
    - String functions (length, indexOf()-starting index of given substring, split()-split into array on given delimiter, startsWith()-returns boolean, endsWith()-returns boolean, toLowerCase()
15. JavaScript Functions
    - first class object-->assigned name, passed as parameter, return result, referenced
    - if don't give value of parameter, undefined when function executes
    - can define default value
    - anonymous functions-->assign to variable w/o giving it a name
    - inner functions--> declare inside other functions, modularize code w/o exposing private details
16. JavaScript Arrow Function
    - first order objects
    - anonymous functions clutter--> more compact-->arrow syntax (use => instead of function keyword)
    - ex. ()=>3; (takes no parameters and always returns 3)
    - example of difference:
           // standard function syntax
            a.sort(function (v1, v2) {
              return v1 - v2;
            });
            // arrow function syntax
            a.sort((v1, v2) => v1 - v2);
    - arrow functions cannot be used for constructors or iterator generators
    - return keyword is optional if no curly braces and only has 1 expression-->automatically returned
    - if curly braces-->acts like standard function and needs return statement
    - inherits this pointer from scope (forms closure)
    - closure allows function to continue referencing creation scope even if it has passed out of scope (returns values from scope it was created not current values of the variables)
    - example (debounce (timewindow, window function to call in this timeframe)-->resets page so expensive calculations are not called too much
17. JavaScript Array
    - sequence of other objects and primitieves
    - zero based index
    - static functions (push (add to end), pop (remove from end), slice (subarray), sort, values (interator for use in for of loop), find (first item satisfied by test function), forEach (function on each item), reduce (reduce array to single item), map (function to map array to new array), filter (function to remove items), every (function to see if all match), some (function to see if any match)
18. JSON
    - JavaScript Object Notation
    - simple, effective way to share and store data, easily convertible to and from JavaScript objects
    - document contains one of the data types (string (""), number, boolean, array[,], object ({"a":1}), null
    - commonly contains object (0 or more key value pairs), key is always a string and object has to be a data type listed above
    - encoded with UTF-8
    - convert to and from JSON with JSON.parse and (JSON.stringify (to))
    - JSON cannot represent JavaScript undefined obj so gets dropped in conversion
19. JavaScript Object and Classes
    - property name must be String or Symbol, value any type
    - can be created with new operator (ex. const obj=new Object ({a:3});)
    - This allows adding properties by simply referencing property name (can be done with obj.prop or obj['prop'])
    - Great for dynamically modifying and manipulating data with indeterminate structure (promises are also objects)
    - Object-literals
    - example: const obj = {
                  a: 3,
                  b: 'fish',
                };
    - Object functions (entries (returns key value pairs), keys, values)
    - Constructor (function that returns an object)
    - can be invoked with "new" operator
    - this depends on scope (for an object, it is a pointer to the object)
    - Classes-->reusable conmponent, explicit consstructor and assumed function declarations
    - Example: class Person {
                  constructor(name) {
                    this.name = name;
                  }
                
                  log() {
                    console.log('My name is ' + this.name);
                  }
                }
    - make properties and functions private by prefixing with #
    - Inheritance: classes can be extended using extends keyword
    - super function-->pararmeters that need to be passed to parent class
    - super keyword--> explicitly access parent function
    - example: class Person {
                  constructor(name) {
                    this.name = name;
                  }
                class Employee extends Person {
                  constructor(name, position) {
                    super(name);
                    this.position = position;
                  }
20. JavaScript Regular expressions
    - textual pattern matcherss (find text in string so you can replace it or know it exists)
    - create using class constructor or regular expression literal
    - const objRegex = new RegExp('ab*', 'i');
    - const literalRegex = /ab*/i;
    - match, replace, search, split (accept regex)
    - flags: g (global search), i (case-insensitive search))
21. JavaScript Rest and Spread
    - rest syntax (...numbers)
    - call it with any number of parameters and automatically combined into array
    - only last parameter can be made rest parameter
    - allows variadic functions
    - Spread (opposite of rest)
    - takes iterable object and expands into function's parameters
22. JavaScript Exceptions
    - try catch and throw syntax
    - throw exception, try and catch block, and finally if want
    - example: try {
              // normal execution code
            } catch (err) {
              // exception handling code
            } finally {
              // always called code
            }
    - throwing exceptions should only happen when something truly exceptional occurs
    - Fallbacks (return something even if something is temperarily unavailable)
23. JavaScript Destructuring
    - pulling indivitual items out o fexisting one
    - done with arrays or objects
    - arrays it is assumed by position
    - for objects, explicitly specify
    - example: const o = { a: 1, b: 'animals', c: ['fish', 'cats'] };      
                    const { a, c } = o;
                    console.log(a, c);
                    // OUTPUT 1, ['fish', 'cats']
    - map names to new variables if wish
    - give default values as well for missing ones
    - can also reassign existing variables
24. Scope
    - Types of scope: global (visible to all code), module (visible to code running in module), function (visible within function), block (visible in block of code (inside {}))
    - var used to be used but it ignores block scope (just assign new value in each function instead of declaring new variable within each section)
    - this represents variable that points to object
    - automatically declared
    - reference this anywhere in JavaScript program
    - value depends on context in which referenced
        1. Global--> represents context for runtime environment (for browser-->browser window object)
        2. Function--> referenced in a function-->refers to object that owns function (either object or gloablThis if function defined outside object), when running JavaScript strict mode--> global function's this variable is undefined 
        3. Object--> referenced in object, refers to object
        4. Example: 'use strict';
                        // global scope
                        console.log('global:', this);
                        console.log('globalThis:', globalThis);
                        // function scope for a global function
                        function globalFunc() {
                          console.log('globalFunctionThis:', this);
                        }
                        globalFunc();
                        // object scope
                        class ScopeTest {
                          constructor() {
                            console.log('objectThis:', this);
                          }
                          // function scope for an object function
                          objectFunc() {
                            console.log('objectFunctionThis:', this);
                          }
                        }
                        new ScopeTest().objectFunc();
                        Running the above code in a browser results in the following.
                        global: Window
                        globalThis: Window
                        globalFunctionThis: undefined
                        objectThis: ScopeTest
                        objectFunctionThis: ScopeTest
                        Note that if we were not using JavaScript strict mode then globalFunctionThis would refer to Window.
    - Closure-->function and its surrounding state
    - whatever variables are accessible when function created are available inside the function
    - true even if pass function outside scope of original creation
    - function creates object with this pointer--> returns object
    - globalThis and then arrow function created with this pointer-->returns globalThis
    - globalThis and returned arrow function created with this pointer--> returns object
25. JavaScript Modules
    - allow for partitioning and sharing of code
    - Node.js introduced concept of modules (now available in JavaScript)
    - JS modules-->ES modules
    - create file-based scope--> must explicitly export objects and import into other file
    - modules can only be called from other modules
    - specify using ES module by including type attribute with value of module in script element
    - if want to use module in global scope-->leak to global scope--> attach event handler or explicitly add function to global window object
    - Example: <html>
                  <body>
                    <script type="module">
                      import { alertDisplay } from './alert.js';
                      window.btnClick = alertDisplay;
                
                      document.body.addEventListener('keypress', function (event) {
                        alertDisplay('Key pressed');
                      });
                    </script>
                    <button onclick="btnClick('button clicked')">Press me</button>
                  </body>
                </html>
    - Use web framework bundler to generate web application distribution code, don't have to worry about differentiationg between scope-->will inject necessary syntax to connect-->bundler exposes ES module directly
26. Document Object Model(DOM)
    - object representation of HTML elements used to render display
    - can write programs that dynamically manipulate the HTML
    - browser provides access to DOM through global variable name (document) that points to root element of the DOM
    - everything in HTML document has a node in the DOM
    - includes elements, attributes, text, comments, whitespace
    - form a big tree with document at the top
    - elements implement DOM element interface (comes from DOM Node Interface)
    - DOM Element Inerface-->iterate child elements, access parent elements, manipulate element attributes
    - querySelectorAll (select elements)
    - can use document.querySelector();
    - textContent (contains all the elements text)
    - innerHTML (textual representation of elementss HTML content)
    - Modifying the DOM
    - create a new element (document.createElement();)
    - insert new element by appending to existing element (parentElement.appendChild();)
    - delete elements (child.parentElement.removeChild(child);)
    - Injecting HTML
    - can inject blocks of HTML into element
    - common attack vector for hackers as users
    - make sure it cannot be manipulated by user
    - injection paths (HTML input controls, URL parameters, HTTP headers)
    - sanitize HTML that contains variables or use DOM manipulation functions instead of using innerHTML
    - Event Listeners
    - function that gets called when event occurs on element
    - add listener to: clipboard, focus, keyboard, mouse, text selection
    - example: const submitDataEl = document.querySelector('#submitData');
                submitDataEl.addEventListener('click', function (event) {
                  console.log(event.type);
                });
    - add event listeners directly  in HTML
    - example: <button onclick='alert("clicked")'>click me</button>
27. Local Storage
    - ability to persistently sotr and retrieve data on user's brower across user sessions and HTML page renderings
    - also cache when data cannot be obtained from the server
    - functions
    - setItem(name, value)
    - getItem(name)
    - removeItem(name)
    - clear()
    - local storage value must be string, number, or boolean
    - if want to store JavaScript object or array-->convert to JSON string with JSON.stringify() when inserted and convert back with JSON.parse()
28. Promises
    - rendering process of HTML executes on single thread
    - cannot take a long time to process JavaScript at beginning
    - use promise for long running executions
    - background execution
    - create promise by calling Promise object constructor and pass executor function that runs asynchronously (promise constructor may return before executor function runs)
    - states of promise execution (pending (currently running asynchronously), fulfilled (completed successfully), rejected (failed to complete))
    - promise executor takes two functions as parameters (resolve, reject)
    - resolve-->fulfilled state, reject-->rejected state
    - promise object has 3 functions: then,catch, finally
    - then-->called if fulfilled, catch-->called if reject, finally--> always called after processing completed
    - example: const coinToss = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                  setTimeout(() => {
                    if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
                      resolve('success');
                    } else {
                      reject('error');
                    }
                  }, 10000);
                });
29. JavaScript Async/await
    - await wraps execution of promise (removing chain functions), blocks the promise state moves to fulfilled or throws exception if moves to rejected
    - set up this way: const coinToss = () => {
                          return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                            setTimeout(() => {
                              if (Math.random() > 0.1) {
                                resolve(Math.random() > 0.5 ? 'heads' : 'tails');
                              } else {
                                reject('fell off table');
                              }
                            }, 1000);
                          });
                        };
    - different versions of setup:
    - then/catch chain version
            coinToss()
              .then((result) => console.log(`Toss result ${result}`))
              .catch((err) => console.error(`Error: ${err}`))
              .finally(() => console.log(`Toss completed`));
    - async, try/catch version 
            try {
              const result = await coinToss();
              console.log(`Toss result ${result}`);
            } catch (err) {
              console.error(`Error: ${err}`);
            } finally {
              console.log(`Toss completed`);
            }
    - async
    - cannot call await unless top level of JavaScript or in function definded with async
    - async transforms function so it returns a promise that will resolve to value previously returned by function
    - return value of async function--> Promise {<state>: value}
    - if async function set up to return new Promise --> Promise {<pending>}
    - await then returns result of promise
    - await function();-->will return value from function
    - great for feching web API that returns JSON (resolve two promises--> network call and converting result to JSON) need to wait until first resolved)
30. Debugging JavaScript
    - simplest way--> console.log
    - use debugger console window to inspect variables
    - execute JavaScript directly in console window
    - browser debugger--> select source tab, select index.js, breakpoints, refresh (reload and pause on breakpoint)
