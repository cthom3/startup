6. SSH into server
    - ssh -i[key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]
7. Caddy
    - webserve that listens for incoming HTTP requests
    - routes requests--> gateway or reverse proxy
8. HTTPS/TLS
    - HTTPS (Secure HyperText Transport Protocol)
    - TLS (negotiates shared secret and used to encrypt data)
    - uses handshakes that verify web certificate
    - Web certificates are generated by trusted 3rd party using public/private key encryption (cheaper because of Let's Encrypt-->creates them for free)
9. HTML
    - elements are enclosed in tags
    - html element--> represents top level page structure
    - head element -->metadata about page and page title
    - body element --> content structure
    - main element --> main content structure
    - attributes give specific detatils of an element
    - id, class helps group things
    - hyperlinks (<a href="__">Title</a>
    - Always inclue <!DOCTYPE html> at the top of document
    - nav (navigational inputs)
    - section (section of main content)
    - aside (aside content of main content)
    - div (block division)
    - span (inline span of content)
    - b (bring attention)
    - img (image reference)
    - dialog (interactive component such as confirmation)
    - Comments (<!-- _____ -->)
    - body has children (header, main, footer)
    - block (div, p)
    - inline (b, span)
    - form (input container and submission)
    - fieldset (labeled input grouping)
    - input (multiple types of user input: text, date, checkbox, color, etc w/ attributes (name, disabled, value, required) w/ validation (certain patterns)
    - select (selection dropdown)
    - optgroup (grouped selection dropdown)
    - option (selection option)
    - textarea (multiline text input)
    - label (individual input label)
    - output (output of input)
    - meter (display value with a known range)
    - index.html default display for web browser
    - external media (img, audio, video)
    - For images, it is best to have them saved in a repository and use the reference links so it does not take as long to load
    - Always include an alt for images (for accessibility)
    - images (<img src="_" alt="_")
    - audio (src, controls or it autoplays and loops)
    - video (src, controls or autoplay, crossorgin="anonymous" (when requssting files from different domain)
    - internal media (svg, canvas)
    - Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)
    - Canvas (2D drawing/animation)
    - Structure is like a tree
    - Be sure to close out all tags
    - Spans hightlight specific text or sections
10. Simon HTML
    - need a deploy file to be able to send to website
    - include navigation on every page
    - Use Live Server to view so you can debug
11. CSS
    - Cascading Style Sheets (style html)
    - responseive to actions of user and device rendered on
    - animate page, deploy custom fonts, respond to user actions, dynamically alter entire layout based on size of device
    - rulesets --> selector, declarations, property, value
    - Example (p (selector){color (property): (declaration) green (value); (rule)}
    - Ways to associate CSS with HTML
          1. Style attribute in specific HTML element
          2. Style element (<style>) within HTML document
          3. HTML link to create hyperlink ref to external file with CSS rules (<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />) ** preferred way
    - Lowest level overrides higher declaration
    - Box model (inner to outer--> content, padding, border, margin)
    - Selectors (* to select all)
    - descendant combinator (ex. section h2)--> has to be a descendent of previous item
    - child-->list of direct children (ex. section > p)
    - general sibling --> list of siblings (ex. div ~ p)
    - adjacent sibling --> list of adjacent sibling (ex. div + p)
    - Class selector (.classname {})
    - Can combine with element name (ex. p.classname{})
    - ID selector (unique for a specific element) (ex. #id {})
    - Attribute selector (ex. p[class='summary'] {} or a[href] {})
    - Pseudo selector--> selects basked on position, hyperlick visit, or mouse interactions (ex. section:hover {})
    - CSS Declarations (property=value)
    - Units for values (pixels (px) or inches (in) or % of parent element or % of minimum viewport dimension (vmin) or multiplier of size of letter m in root font (rem), pt(number of points 1/72 in), cm (centimenters), em (multiplier of width of letter m in parent font), ex (height of element font), vw, vh (viewport width or height), vmax (%of viewportlarger dimension)
    - Color: keyword (red), RGB (#00FFAA22 or #0FA2), rgb function (rgb(128,255,128,0.5) with opacity as last thing), HSL (hsl(180,30%,90%,0.5) hue,saturation (how gray), light (how bright))
    - font-family to import fonts, list several in order of desire b/c some systems don't have some types
    - font families--> serif, sans-serif, fixed, symbol (emojis or arrows)
    - @font-face {} to load one you provide
    - load from font provider (@import url()) using Good Font Service
    - Animation--> use animation properties, define keyframes (how it looks at different times)
    - in element reference animation (animation-name and animation-duration)
    - @keyframes nameofanimation { from {} to{} }
    - can add % of the way through stops in between from and to 
12. Responsive Design
    - change how HTML element displayed
    - none (don't display)
    - block (width of parent element)
    - inline (width as big as contents)
    - flex (flexible orientation)
    - grid (grid orientation)
    - include meta tag in head element so mobile browser scaling does not get in the way (<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" />
    - float (moves element to left or right and allows inline elements to wray around) (ex. aside {float:right; } stays of right side while text flows around)
    - Media queries (@media) dynamically detects size and orientation, can use it too see which side is longest on device so we know how to orient) or to know when to not display some items
    - Grid (display:grid; ) (fr-->gractional unit of parentss total width)
    - Flexbox (partition application into areas that move around as window resized or orientation changes) (display: flex; flex-direction:column or row; flex:1(one-fractional unit)) (row-->side by side, column-->on top of each other)
    - Frameworks (tailwind-->newer, apply to specific HTML elements--> mostly in HTML file) (bootstrap--> (include in head <link href="", rel="stylesheet", integrity="", crossorigin-"anonymous" />) (include at end of body element (incorporate javascript module) <script src="" integrity="" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>)
    - Debugging (inspect, Elements tab, Styles pane)-->can change things directly in debugger
    - flex to delimit header, main, and footer (responsive to different screen sizes)
    - absolute position relative to parent elements
14. JavaScript
    - officially ECMAScript--> weakly typed language
    - most used programming language (web servers and serverless functions)
    - executed using an interpreter instead of compiling (very portable but allows for errors (only discovered when crashes during execution))
    - console.log(___) outputs ot debugger console
    - concatenate using +
    - write functions (function name(variable){return variable+' ';}
    - line comment //
    - block comment /* */
    - end statements with ;, code blocks/scope defined w/ {}
    - console.time('demo time'); code; console.timeEnd('demo time');
    - console.count(_);
    - Adding to HTML
          - src attribute of script element (reference js file)
          - directly in HTML in script element (ex. write function here)
    - onclick-->creates event listener for DOM events that call code in attribute value
    - declare variables with let or const, never var
    - primitive types: null (not assigned value), undefined (has not been defined), Boolean, number, bigInt (arbitrary magnitude), String, Symbol (unique value)
    - object types: object (collection of properties represented by name-value pairs (ex. {a:3, b:'fish'}), function, date, array, map, JSON (lightweight data-interchange format (ex. {"a":3,"b":"fish"})
    - operators: + (add), - (subtract), * (multiply), / (divide), === (equality), for strings (+ and ===)
    - type conversions: weakly typed-->type changes when assigned new value or automatically converted in certain contexts (automatic converstion) (== less intuitive use === for strict inequality)
    - examples (2 + '3';
        // OUTPUT: '23'
        2 * '3';
        // OUTPUT: 6
        [2] + [3];
        // OUTPUT: '23'
        true + null;
        // OUTPUT: 1
        true + undefined;
        // OUTPUT: NaN)
    - examples (1 == '1';
        // OUTPUT: true
        null == undefined;
        // OUTPUT: true
        '' == false;
        // OUTPUT: true)
      -examples (1 === '1';
        // OUTPUT: false
        null === undefined;
        // OUTPUT: false
        '' === false;
        // OUTPUT: false)
    - Conditionals (if, else, else if)
    - ternary operator (ex. a===1? console.log(1) : console.log('not 1');)
    - boolean operations (&&(and) || (or) ! (not))
    - loops (for, for in, for of, while, do while, switch)
    - for in (const name in obj-->prints out first part of each object, const name in array-->prints out the array index)
    - for of (const val of arr-->print value at each index)
    - break or continue also available
    - string-->specified by ',", or ` (` are string literal that could have JavaScript evaluated in place and concatenated into string)
    - string literal replacement specifier ${} use backticks
    - use backticks to create multiline strings w/o having to use \n
    - Unicode-->must internationalize (uses sequence of 16-bit unsigned integers)
    - String functions (length, indexOf()-starting index of given substring, split()-split into array on given delimiter, startsWith()-returns boolean, endsWith()-returns boolean, toLowerCase()
